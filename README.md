# Boring Back Story
I've felt interested in hardware hackery things for a little while, but haven't done anything with it.... other than buy a Raspberry Pi and random things.

My project idea is to build a live scoreboard powered by http://boxscoremania.com and the MLB data that it pulls down, coupled with an LCD display and some LED lights and maybe something for sound?
